<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

With this project we aim at solving and helping out with garbage with two main parts: The Web App and The Device. <br />
<br />
For example, inside a garbage container we would mount a device inside the garbage container or bin. The device would then send the GPS coordinates along with information to our database.
The thought later on would be to run Machine Learning on the image and train AI to recognize how full it is and send that information too. That would require us to use another server/middleman to process the image. 
The last resort would be to use a laser distance measurement device to simply see how much garbage would be inside.

Here's what the device will send in a JSON format:
* ID
* Title
* Description
* Image taken by camera
* Longitude & Latitude

The Web App would then be displaying the information from the database inside of a map. <br />
Think Google Maps but it displays markers where the device is. <br />
Once you click on the marker you can view information about the device and see a picture that displays how full it is along side with a quick display on how full the device is if the image is unclear.
There will be a dashboard that can view the infomration in a more structured way too and contain multiple devices for quick listing.

So in general it would feature:
* A Device mounted inside the container(s).
* A Web App that shows the information along with the locations on a map.

We don't have all the features finished or planned out yet. But we'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes or features by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

So far into the prototype we have a:
* Device that runs with Raspberry Pi and USB/Pi Cam and sends information and picture to the DB.
* Web App Server that runs with Node, Express and mongoDB and working API that creates routes to GET or POST information.
* Web App Client that runs with ReactJS and shows a Mapbox map together with locations and information of the device.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Mongo DB](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [PyMongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver)


<!-- GETTING STARTED DEVICE -->
## Getting Started With Device

To get a local copy of the device application up and running follow theese steps.

### Prerequisites Device

This is require to run the Device:
* Python 3.7.3
* Raspberry Pi / Python Instance
* USB Camera
* A MongoDB Connection
* Pip
<br />
Pip should be installed from Python. Otherwise choose correct way of installing depending on your OS.


### Installation Device
<br />
Go to this <a href="https://github.com/Backbonzo/SchoolProjectV2/blob/main/prototype/DeviceGarbageCam/README.md" target="_blank">Readme</a> for instructions on how to install the device application.

<!--
1. Clone the repo if already not done so.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/backbonzo/SchoolProjectV2.git
   ```
2. Cd into the correct directory
   ```sh
   cd prototype/DeviceGarbageCam/
   ```
3. Install PIP packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Change credentials inside configCred.py
   ```python
   user= Mongo DB Username
   password= Mongo DB Password
   cl= Mongo DB Cluster
   db= Database Name
   coll= Collection Name in db
   description= A Description of the device
   latitude= Hardcoded Latitude (will change later)
   longitude= Hardcoded Longitude (will change later)
   ```
5. Run!
   ```sh
   python3 track.py
   ```
-->

<!-- GETTING STARTED WEBAPP -->
## Getting Started With Web App

To get up and running with the server and the client install the prerequisites and read the installation Readme.

### Prerequisites Web App

This requires NPM to be installed.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* MongoDB instance (cloud or local).
  ```sh
  Put the connection string into DATABASE_URL inside of servers .env
  ```
  
  * MapBox Account (to get token).
  ```sh
  Put the mapbox token into DATABASE_URL inside of clients .env
  ```

### Installation Web App
<br />
Go to this <a href="https://github.com/Backbonzo/SchoolProjectV2/blob/main/prototype/web-app/README.md" target="_blank">Readme</a> for instructions on how to install the client and server application.
<!--
1. Clone the repo if already not done so.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/backbonzo/SchoolProjectV2.git
   ```
2. CD to the right directory (either client or server depends on what you want to run)
   ```sh
   cd prototype/web-app/client
   or
   cd prototype/web-app/server
   ```
   
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
5. Change ENV variables for server
   ```sh
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=PORT NUMBER
   DATABASE_URL=MONGODB CONNECTION URL
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:port
   ```
   
6. Run in development mode
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This requires nodemon to be installed.
   
7. Change ENV variables for the client
   ```sh
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=MAPBOX_TOKEN_KEY
   ```

8. Run the client
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
<!--
Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
-->
Currently we have the devices hard coded. Later on we will publish a demo website that you can access and use to see a few example devices.
<br />
It's a bit harder to showcase the Device, we recommend that you run a device on your own with a local setup if you can.

<!-- _For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ -->



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/XL7BJNWe/school-project-v2) for a list of proposed features and todo's (and known issues).
<br />
We are currently in the <strong>Prototype</strong> phase.
Heres how the client is designed:

Heres how the server is designed:
<br />
There will be quite alot of differences between the prototype and the finished product. We will list them below soon. 
<!-- See the [open issues](https://github.com/backbonzo/SchoolProjectV2/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues). -->
